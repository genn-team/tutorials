# Tutorials
This repository contains several sets of tutorials on [PyGeNN](https://genn-team.github.io/) and mlGeNN

## [CompNeuro 101](comp_neuro_101/)
Building spiking neural network models in GeNN

## [MNIST inference](mnist_inference/)
Perform MNIST inference by converting a pre-trained ANN to an SNN

## [Insect-inspired MNIST classification](mushroom_body/)
Train a model of the insect mushroom body using an STDP learning rule to classify MNIST.

## [mlGeNN](ml_genn/)
Perform inference with pre-trained SNNs and train SNNs from scratch with EventProp or e-prop.

## Helpers
Additionally, this repository contains some notebooks you can use as a starting point for your own GeNN-based work:
